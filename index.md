### significance of boba!
Personally, bubble tea has been linked to my childhood because it has always been my favorite drink as a child and served as my comfort drink! Evidently, people today use boba as a way to hang out and meet new friends. The term _boba date_ has recently grown in adolescent generations, which refers to getting boba as an ideal date. Over the past couple of years, bubble tea has reinforced social cohesion among people in some young generation.
